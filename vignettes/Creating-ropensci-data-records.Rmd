Each rOpenSci package which accesses a particular dataset should include a `data.json` file.  This file should be placed in the package root directory and be added to `.Rbuildignore`.  The `data.json` file should conform to Google's [Structured Data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data) format.  Users can check their document interactively using the [Structured Data Testing Tool](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool).   A list of all recognized `Dataset` properties (metadata fields) can be found at <http://schema.org/Dataset>.  

If ncessary, multiple datasets (and other objects such as the `DataCatalog`) can be documented in a single JSON file by creating a separate `@context` element for the `schema.org` context and a `@graph` element containing an array of `Dataset` type objects, e.g.

```
{
"@context": "http:/schema.org",
"@graph": [
  {
    "@type": "Dataset",
    ...
  },
    {
    "@type": "Dataset",
    ...
  },
  ...
]
}
